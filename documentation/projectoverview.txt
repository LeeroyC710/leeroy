Initial project goals where to create a crud application that will allow users to sign up(register) on to the platform, 
login into the account with the saved input details during registration mode
create an event for to ensure the app's full functionality and purpose, I managed to ensure that the app was CRUD in most parts 
of the app however, this was implemented through trial and error and based on the time constraints i was not able to apply CRUD
functionality on the other part of the app, so for future reference I would like to apply to crud features on the event page 
to allow users to delete event which i will include a cancel button. Theres other vulnerabilites to the current app built as
placing the data on the event with dates is rather a challenge since its charecter count sensitive. I would need to reupdate the
models.py, forms.py and htmls pages to stop this issue from causing any more problems for the future users. In terms of 
technology that can be used to make the app more appealing on its front-end would be to use bootstrap in order to style the pages
add colours which will consists of css langauage. I faced a lot of problems with the built which resulted shutting down of some 
vms due to unresponsiveness and sometimes finding it difficult to install some components needed for automated testing. I believe 
with more experience in  python coding, I should be able to add more features to the app and maintain building more by even adding 
another table to allow more usability.
